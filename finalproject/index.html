    <p>This page includes some of my lessons learned and challenges during this final project and overal reflection of this course.</p>
      <h2>Challenges and Triumphs</h2> 
      <p>I encountered various challenges while working on this final projects. One of the initial challenges was how to include all the labs into one website and making it responsive.
        Also, i had problem with making the CSS work for the all the lab so it look like on sigle website. My triumphs include successfully implementing custom CSS styles to make the all the labs into one and adding some JavaScript to it. 
        Also, I found that we have to test our website in multiple browser and devices to ensure compatibility and avoid irregularities in the pages. </p> 
      <h2>Lessons Learned from Testing on Multiple Browsers and Devices</h2> 
      <p>When i tested my website in different browser, i did not get any issue with formating. All the format and links were working properly. But i have seen 
        that depending on different browser, formats and other stuff getting mixed up so it is necessary to make the website compatible 
        for all browser. Also, when i tested website from phone, all the format and link were working and it was mobile responsive. The biggest lesson here was it is important to test multiple browser compatibility to ensure consistent user experience. </p>
    <h2>Reflection on the Course</h2>
        
          <p>  As i look back into very fist lab to final project, i feel like i have learned alot of new skill regarding Html, css and even some javascript.
         From understanding HTML structure to implementing dynamic and responsive web designs, i feels more confident in my ability then before i started this class.
         I did had some issue when doing some labs like implementing the resposive design adding some javascript. I think there alot more to learn about how to build
         a professional size website but with the experience i have gain, i look forward to applying what I've learned in future projects and learned more new stuff. Some of the
         site that really helped me are: </p>
