    <p>This page includes some of my lessons learned and challenges during this final project and overal reflection of this course.</p>
      <h2>Challenges and Triumphs</h2> 
      <p>I encountered various challenges while working on this final projects. One of the initial challenges was how to include all the labs into one website and making it responsive.
        Also, i had problem with making the CSS work for the all the lab so it look like on sigle website. My triumphs include successfully implementing custom CSS styles to make the all the labs into one and adding some JavaScript to it. 
        Also, I found that we have to test our website in multiple browser and devices to ensure compatibility and avoid irregularities in the pages. </p> 
      <h2>Lessons Learned from Testing on Multiple Browsers and Devices</h2> 
      <p> Testing my website on different browsers and devices revealed how critical cross-browser compatibility is. I learned that what works perfectly on Chrome may not work as expected on Firefox or Safari.
        The biggest lesson here was the importance of using standardized, well-tested code and tools to ensure a consistent user experience. On mobile devices, I had to adjust some of my design choices to ensure
        it looked and functioned well on smaller screens. </p>
    <h2>Reflection on the Course</h2>
        <p>
        This course has been incredibly valuable in teaching me the fundamentals of web development. From understanding HTML structure to implementing dynamic and responsive web designs, 
        I've gained a well-rounded skill set. I feel more confident in my ability to approach new projects and collaborate with others. The hands-on experience has been essential to my growth as a web developer, and I look forward to applying what I've learned in future projects.
