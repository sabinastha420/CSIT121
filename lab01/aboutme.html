            <p>
                Hi everyone,<br><br>
                    My name is Sabina Shrestha. I am from Nepal. I worked as a Registered Nurse for around 6 years back in my home country.
                    I saw one quote on the internet and this is my favorite quote from that day, which is by George Addair 'Everything you've ever wanted is sitting on the other side of fear.'             </p>

                My current major is General Studies but I am planning to switch to Nursing Degree.

                I like to stay in a peaceful area and listen to the music. Beside this, I love to dance.
