            <h2>Site Organization</h2>
            <p>I think the site is organized with Hierarchical organization. It is divided into key section:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plan Your Visit</li>
                <li>Meet the Animals</li>

                <li>Support the Zoo</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>CRAP Design Principles</h2>
            <p>The website is using mix of <strong>Repetition</strong> and <strong>Alignment</Strong>. For exampel: All the header uses the same font style and size and the images of animals were aligned withe the text that describes them. consistent colors and fonts to create a unified look.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Accessibility and Effectiveness</h2>
            <p><strong>Audit Score:</strong> According to Accessibility Checker, it recevied the audit score of 67.</p>
            <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> The site effectively supports users in completing actions accurately. For exampel: when i click on the buy ticket, it took me to the page where i could purchase ticket.
             Also, when i click on explore more animal button, it took me the page where i could use search bar to seach for animals in the Zoo.</p>
            <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Users can perform tasks quickly without delays. All the button i tested redirected me to the appropriate location.
                 It also has a simple navgitaion bar which allows user to quickly find the key sections.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <p>Overall, the website for the Maryland Zoo is very engaging and well built. My only recomedation would be fix some of the issue relate to accessibility that came during the accessibility checker so everyone
